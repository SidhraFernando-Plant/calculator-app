## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

To begin with, I built the static UI using HTML and CSS. This included implementing grid display to have the keys show up correctly. I then made the calculator functioning using vanilla JS to allow the user to press numbers, perform various operations, and reset/delete.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had not had much exposure to CSS Grid prior to this project, previously relying on Flexbox. I have now learnt how to set up a component that uses display, including constructing the template for the grids and columns and defining each element in the grid to be placed as desired.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn about grid, particularly more advanced layouts that are not simple grids like the keyboard in this project. I also intend to expand on this project in the near future, implementing the themes and making the decimal point functional (these features have not yet been added).
